      contents: `At mindit.io, my most recent role has been as a Frontend Developer in a brand-new project which started a few days before my arrival. In the beginning, there was a major need in developing the architecture and starting the development of the interface as soon as possible. In this case, it was about an application in the pharmaceutical domain, and the client was in a haste to see a palpable result. We used Angular as the frontend framework, accompanied by some nice adjacent technologies to ease our work, such as Redux and OpenAPI. The backend application was written initially in Spring, but currently migrating to .NET because we decided that it will fit better for a future integration with other Microsoft services. I've worked in a team of professionals with whom I related very well and our teamwork factor was beyond the limits.`

Viola finds herself shipwrecked in Illyria and, assuming that her brother Sebastian has died in the wreck, disguises herself as a man to gain a position in Duke Orsino's court. Orsino sends Viola (whom he knows as Cesario) to deliver a message to his love, Olivia. Olivia, however, dislikes the Duke. She falls in love with Viola, who she thinks is a man. Eventually, Viola's brother Sebastian, who in fact was unharmed in the wreck, reappears. At a critical moment, Viola's true identity is revealed when members of the court notice the similarities between her and Sebastian. Olivia quickly falls in love with Sebastian, and Viola confesses her love for the Duke.
