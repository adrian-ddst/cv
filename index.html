                <h3>Frontend Developer - mindit.io</h3>
                <p class="text-muted">Aug 2021 - Present</p>

                <p>At mindit.io, my most recent role has been as a Frontend Developer in a brand-new project which started a few days before my arrival. In the beginning, there was a major need in developing the architecture and starting the development of the interface as soon as possible. In this case, it was about an application in the pharmaceutical domain, and the client was in a haste to see a palpable result. We used Angular as the frontend framework, accompanied by some nice adjacent technologies to ease our work, such as Redux and OpenAPI. The backend application was written initially in Spring, but currently migrating to .NET because we decided that it will fit better for a future integration with other Microsoft services. I&#39;ve worked in a team of professionals with whom I related very well and our teamwork factor was beyond the limits.</p>

                <p>In the summer of 2020 I was assigned to work on an on-going project as a Frontend Developer. The project incorporated a quantities management application for a large consuming goods company. The frontend was designed in Angular, and used a lot of utility JavaScript libraries such as RxJS, Lodash, etc. We&#39;ve also implemented Unit Tests, with the help of Jasmine and Karma. In this project, I&#39;ve also contributed to the backend side of the project, as it was written in Spring. It was easier for me to learn Spring by solving tasks and experiencing the backend hands-on. Later on, after a couple of months have passed, I was designated as the frontend lead on the project due to my proven interest and hard work. I was in charge of deciding design patterns, planning on new implementations, discussions with the client and estimates for every functionality. The team was great, the most friendly I&#39;ve ever met. We were first of all friends, then colleagues, and I also had the chance to be the &quot;buddy&quot; for new colleagues that needed to get aquainted with the project or to help them learn a specific technology.</p>

                <p>In 2019 I started my career as a Software Developer at mindit.io. I went through a 3-month internship program, during which I worked among other experienced developers who were willing to help me grow. During the internship, I became interested in Frontend Development and I started investing a lot of interest in learning about this amazing part of Web Development. After the internship period has ended, mindit.io offered me to continue the collaboration and assigned me to an on-going project in the company. In this project, I was designated as a Frontend Developer and I worked in a big team, composed mostly of the people to whom I was close also during the internship. It was nice to be already familiar with the people. As for the project, it was about sales of consuming goods, where users would be able to publish their products with the corresponding price, in order to be validated by various commissions. The project was pre-generated with the help of Jhipster, who created a very interesting web application structure ready to be developed and deployed. It consisted of a Spring backend application and an Angular frontend application. Although Jhipster offered quick development possibilities and created something palpable very fast, in time, we decided to remove it progressively from the app because of the low scalability it provided.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <h4>Hard Skills</h4>
        <p>
            During my career, my main focus has been on Web Technologies, especially on one of the most powerful and popular frontend frameworks - Angular. I developed
            my skills around this framework in order to gain knowledge at every step, given that it is a very large technology. In the past, I have worked on multiple
            web applications that used Angular as the frontend framework (having the last one using Angular 12), where my job was to create beautiful designs, develop new functionalities and possibilities for the users, 
            and also to contribute to the architecture of the frontend application. I communicated constantly with the backend teams in order to integrate the backend services using
            REST API, having the objective of persisting data provided by the user in the interface. In the process of operating the data and managing HTTP requests, I have used one of
            my favourite JavaScript libraries, RxJS. I consider this library to be extremely powerful, I felt that I can accomplish almost anything in this section by knowing how to use
            this library, because, the user could practically navigate freely through the app, while asynchronous actions and callbacks were managed "behind the scenes". <br><br>
            In the most cases, I used TypeScript in the development process, alternating between this and JavaScript, given that TS is a subset. I love TypeScript because it brought a new
            vision to Frontend Development, by being strongly typed. This, and the object-oriented factor it brings on the table, have made TypeScript written applications to be very organised and 
            easy to understand for newcomers.<br><br>
            As for the structure and design of the interface, I have used HTML styled by CSS extensions SASS and LESS. In order to bring life to web interfaces, I have also used frontend open source 
            toolkits, such as Bootstrap, PrimeNG, and Angular Material, which provided beautiful templates for forms, tables, and basically almost anything you would need in a website, templates which
            I've customized myself in theme with the application's requirements. In some cases, I was also required by clients to create SVGs and other figures from scratch in order to use them in the 
            application, considering my experience with Adobe Illustrator.<br><br>
            In order to speed up the development time and to grow my knowledge, I have also learned backend technologies such as Spring and Spring Boot, which were used in a couple of projects I've worked on. I have also
            used Spring to develop the backend services for my bachelor's degree thesis application. Other than that, I interested myself in the Python language, and I developed an application personally which uses 
            Python Flask as backend service.<br><br>
            In the database management domain, I am experienced with DBMSs such as MySQL and SSMS. My knowledge covers DDL, DML and PL/SQL.<br><br>
            As for VCS, my favourite is Git. I have used it for every project I have ever worked on.
